## Getting Started

To run the project:

```bash
yarn start
```

The project is using Next.js for the FE, and simple express server in the BE. 

Using react-query for data fetching

Using react-hook-form to manage input state + validation.

Using tailwindcss for styling, as it's quite simple to write responsive styles with it.

Added some tests, not to all components - to show the kind of test i'm writing.

The design is pretty basic - I'm not much of a designer, so empty/error/loading states are simple.
